# Cool-Navbar
I created a simple little navigation bar that is fully responsive. This site uses the Roboto Google Font and some corporate &amp; coffee ipsum. I also used font awesome for the icon examples. This site is inteneded to use SVG Icons to make the icons and logo change colour when hovered over.
